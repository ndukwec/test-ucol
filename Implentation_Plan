Okay so I have gone ahead and implemented a teachers closed test, a grader.py and a grade.sh script which will call the
grader.py with the gitlab variables(students email) that triggered our pipeline and passed the teacher test
Note that only if student passes the teachers test will the above work. again only if they pass the test, if not our build
pipeline should fail

The students email who passed the test will be sent to the teachers email and the api we'll setup which will post the
students email to a website or to another api.
The functions in the grader.py are named appropriately, in grader.py all the magic happens.

Other Options
There's also other options if we didn't want our in house custom api, we could use gitlab's api or create webhooks
that will send pipeline information to our webhook receiver.

For gitlab webhooks see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html
For gitlab api see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/

Next Steps
my next step will be to implement an api in django which will receive the post request we'll send from our grader.py
and update a webpage with the students email who passed our test, students can go to this django powered website to see
if their email shows up i.e to know if they passed or not
