Okay so I have gone ahead and implemented a closed test and a grader.py script which will grade the student.
There are two possible things that we could do now:
    a.) We could create a webhook receiver that will send the details of our pipeline events to the
    teachers email, this will include the students email, and the build status
    see https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#pipeline-events

    b.) The other option is to use our grader.py to send an email to the teacher or even a post request to another API
    with information about our build status, if and only if the student passed code worked, i.e if our
    closed test ran successfully


I will be choosing option b.) as it's the quickest option,
we can always explore/implement option a.) when I get the job :-)
